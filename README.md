# vlc_player
vlc player made from python using tkinter GUI,so I can watch shows on my PC like a streaming app.
some of the features:
*can go through episodes(next/previous buttons).
*new episode will automaticly start when an episode has ended.
*current season,episode and time in episode will be saved in a database,and will start automaticly when the app is opened again.
